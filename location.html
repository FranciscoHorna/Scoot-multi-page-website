                    <h2>Cultural Identity</h2>
                    <p>
                        Salsa helped Latinos, especially Nuyoricans, embrace their heritage in a time of social and racial tension. Through Afro-Caribbean rhythms and Spanish lyrics, artists celebrated their roots and challenged mainstream narratives that erased their culture.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Political Activism</h2>
                    <p>
                        Activist groups like the Young Lords recognized the power of music to unite people. Salsa performances often took place at rallies, community events, and cultural centers where messages of empowerment and revolution spread through song.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Lyrics and Meaning</h2>
                    <p>
                        Many salsa tracks carried deeper meanings, touching on freedom, struggle, and solidarity. The lyrics mirrored the everyday experiences of marginalized groups, transforming music into a collective call.
                    </p>
                
                    <h2>Community Impact</h2>
                    <p>
                        Salsa clubs, block parties, and concerts became more than entertainment venues; they were safe spaces for activism and cultural pride. These gatherings fostered a sense of belonging and fueled social movements across Latino communities.
