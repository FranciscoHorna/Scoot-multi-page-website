                    <p>At 2,430 meters above sea level in the Peruvian Andes, an architectural marvel is located. Machu Picchu, considered one of the Seven Wonders of the World by Unesco in 1983, is a testimony of Inca's advanced engineering in the 15th century. Builts without iron tools, the precision cut of the stones fits perfectly that even modern days engineers can't explain. It is located 
                        in an strategic location hidden between peaks that helped to remain it undiscovered by Spanish conquistators. Furthermore, Machu Picchu's sophisticated agricultural terraces, irrigation systems and astronimical alignments
                        demonstrate that Incas were more than builders but also astronomers and mathematicians. The Inca Empire was the largest empire of pre-Columbian America and their legacy influence modern practices worldwide. </p>

                    <h2>The Tumi</h2>
                    <p> Incas and other cultures used the tumi as a ceremonial knife to make rituals, sacrifices and surgical procedures. This knife had a symbolic meaning related with the Sun God (inti), and it is made of gold. Now, the tumi
                    is considered a symbol of culture for peruvians and is represented in art, tourism and souveniers. An interesting fact, many families in Peru hand a tumi on a wall because they consider that it brings luck and prosperity. </p>
