                    <p>
                    I used to hate public speaking because I had problems with nervousness, memory, anxiety, and lack of confidence. I was terrified to present any topic even though I was an expert and I was speaking in my native language, Spanish.

                    <h2>The Turning Point at NMSU: Public Speaking in English</h2>
                    <p>You can imagine that if public speaking was hard for me in my own native language, in English it would have been worse. In my first semester at 
                       New Mexico State University, I had to take a class called "Introduction to Communication" and I was terrified because I had to make two presentations of 7 minutes each throughout the semester.
                        In the first presentation, I was so nervous that my hands were shaking, I forgot everything and I had really bad pronunciation. I was disappointed with myself because I didn't get a good grade. Therefore,
                        I proposed to improve in public speaking to get an A in the class, and I improved by doing the following:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="skills-list">
                        <li>Practicing my English pronunciation by watching videos on YouTube.</li>
                        <li>Understanding the topic rather than memorizing a script.</li>
                        <li>Practicing a test presentation with my friends to seek feedback.</li>
                        <li>Learning from other speakers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

                <div class="culture-text">
                    <h2>My Achievement</h2>
                    <p>In the last presentation of the communication course, I was well prepared to deliver the presentation on time without any issues I had in the past. Finally, on the last day of classes, the entire class congratulated me on my improvement in public speaking. I was proud of myself because I overcame my fear of public speaking and improved my English skills.
