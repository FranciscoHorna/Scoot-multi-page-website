                    <h2>The Basic Step</h2>
                    <p>The basic salsa step is the foundation of the dance, following an eight-count rhythm that’s divided into two sets of four beats. Dancers typically step forward with their left foot on count one, shift their weight back to the center on count two, and pause briefly on count four. Then, they step back with their right foot on count five, return to the center on count six, and wait again on count eight. These pauses, combined with the alternating forward and backward steps, create salsa’s signature quick-quick-slow rhythm. This rhythm gives the dance its lively and infectious energy, allowing dancers to move smoothly with the beat while still leaving room for expression and style. Even though the basic step seems simple, mastering it is key to developing the fluid hip motion and confident posture that make salsa so captivating to watch and perform. </p>

                    <h2>Hip and Body Movement</h2>
                    <p> Salsa’s signature look comes from the natural hip motion created by shifting body weight from one foot to the other. Dancers kept their upper body steady and relaxed while their hips moved smoothly in rhythm. This movement is what gives salsa its fluid, rhythmic style and makes the dance feel more expressive rather than robotic. </p>

                    <h2>Partner Connection and Turns </h2>
                    <p>Salsa is often danced with a partner, so communication and timing are key. The leader gently guides the follower using hand signals and body cues. Spins and turns are common, especially for the follower, and they usually happen on quick beats (1-2-3 or 5-6-7). Good dancers stay connected through light hand pressure, eye contact, and awareness of the music rhythm to stay in sync. </p>
